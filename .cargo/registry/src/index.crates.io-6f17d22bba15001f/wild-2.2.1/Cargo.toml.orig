[features]
# Give up on trying to accurately emulate Unix-like argument quoting semantics,
# and always interpret `*` (etc.) as file path patterns, even in quoted strings.
#
# This affects only Windows.
#
# This creates possibility of non-file arguments that contain `*` to be interpreted as file paths.
# OTOH it makes it easier for users to use globs on paths with spaces, and to call executables via tools/APIs that always quote args.
#
# Don't enable this feature from libraries. This decision should be left to binaries.
